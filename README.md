> Inspired by the pioneering work of [The AI Scientist](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist), [FARS](https://analemma.ai/blog/introducing-fars/), and [AutoResearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), Sibyl now targets a **Codex CLI native** workflow built around `AGENTS.md`, repo-local `sibyl` commands, MCP servers, and isolated `codex exec` child runs.

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

Sibyl is a **fully automated scientific discovery system** that autonomously drives ML research from literature survey to paper submission. It operates as an **autonomous research organization**: 20+ specialized AI agents debate ideas, design and run GPU experiments, write papers, and critically review their own work — all without human intervention.

What truly sets Sibyl apart is its **dual-loop architecture**:

- **Inner Loop — Research Iteration**: Each project automatically iterates across every dimension — refining hypotheses based on experiment results, re-planning experiments, rewriting papers, pivoting to alternative ideas when needed — until quality meets publication standards.
- **Outer Loop — System Self-Evolution**: Sibyl learns from the research process itself. After every iteration, it classifies issues across 8 categories, accumulates reusable lessons, and automatically updates its own agent prompts, scheduling strategies, and architectural patterns. **The system that runs your research is itself getting better at running research.**

### What Makes Sibyl Different?

- **Autonomous Multi-Dimensional Iteration** — Not just "run experiments and write a paper." Every aspect of the research improves automatically across iterations: ideas sharpen through multi-agent debate, experiments expand with better baselines and ablations, writing tightens under 6-agent cross-review, and resource utilization optimizes through GPU scheduling feedback. The quality gate decides when to stop or pivot — no human in the loop.
- **Self-Evolving System** — Most AI research tools are static — they run the same way every time. Sibyl evolves. It extracts lessons from every research iteration (issues, success patterns, efficiency metrics), keeps them time-weighted and context-filtered, and injects the relevant ones back into agent prompts. Across projects, the system accumulates institutional knowledge — each project makes every future project better.
- **Codex CLI Native** — Not a wrapper around API calls. Built around Codex CLI, `AGENTS.md`, MCP tools, repo-local orchestration commands, and optional `codex exec` child runs for isolated roles.

## Get Started

### Recommended: Run It With Codex CLI

Clone the repo, create the local environment, and start Codex from either the repo root or a workspace root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sibyl-Research-Team/sibyl-research-system.git
cd sibyl-research-system
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
tmux new -s sibyl                                           # recommended: persistent session
codex
```

Then either use the shell entrypoints directly:

```
sibyl start spec.md
sibyl continue .
```

or ask Codex to read `AGENTS.md` plus `.codex/loop-prompt.txt` in the target workspace and continue the Sibyl control loop.

### Manual Setup

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual setup instructions</summary>

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+, Node.js 18+
- [Codex CLI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/)
- GPU server with SSH access
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` when using Codex MCP or non-ChatGPT auth flows
- **tmux** (strongly recommended) — enables persistent sessions and automatic recovery via Sentinel watchdog. Install: `brew install tmux` (macOS) / `apt install tmux` (Linux)

#### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sibyl-Research-Team/sibyl-research-system.git
cd sibyl-research-system
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh    # Interactive: creates venv, installs deps, configures MCP
```

`setup.sh` also adds or updates `export SIBYL_ROOT="..."` in your shell rc file so workspace-root Codex sessions and helper scripts can resolve the repo root.

#### 2. Configure MCP Servers

Two MCP servers are required. `setup.sh` configures them interactively, but for manual setup the preferred path is `codex mcp add ...` so the configuration stays Codex-scoped:

```bash
codex mcp add ssh-mcp-server -- npx -y @fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server \
  --host YOUR_GPU_IP --port 22 --username YOUR_USER --privateKey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

codex mcp add arxiv-mcp-server -- /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/sibyl-research-system/.venv/bin/python3 -m arxiv_mcp_server
```

If you already manage Claude Code MCP servers through JSON, update the existing MCP config instead of creating a second source of truth:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@fangjunjie/ssh-mcp-server",
               "--host", "YOUR_GPU_IP", "--port", "22",
               "--username", "YOUR_USER",
               "--privateKey", "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"]
    },
    "arxiv-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/sibyl-research-system/.venv/bin/python3",
      "args": ["-m", "arxiv_mcp_server"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Server names must be exact: `"ssh-mcp-server"` and `"arxiv-mcp-server"`.

#### 3. Configure GPU Server

Create `config.yaml` at project root (git-ignored):

```yaml
ssh_server: "default"
remote_base: "/home/user/sibyl_system"
max_gpus: 4
language: zh
codex_enabled: false
```

Use `ssh_server: "default"` when `ssh-mcp-server` was registered with explicit `--host/--username` arguments. If your MCP setup resolves a named SSH host alias instead, use that alias.

#### 4. Run

```bash
# `setup.sh` normally writes this for you; set it manually only if you skipped setup.sh
export SIBYL_ROOT=/path/to/sibyl-system

# Repo root: setup, init, status, migrate, evolve
cd "$SIBYL_ROOT"
tmux new -s sibyl-admin
codex

# Workspace root: actual project execution (recommended)
cd "$SIBYL_ROOT/workspaces/my-project"
tmux new -s sibyl-my-project
codex

# Shell entrypoints:
sibyl start spec.md               # New project from this workspace's spec
sibyl continue .                  # Resume the current workspace
```

> **Why tmux?** Sibyl experiments can run for hours. Running inside tmux ensures the session persists through terminal disconnections. The Sentinel watchdog runs in a sibling tmux pane and automatically restarts Codex if it crashes or goes idle.

> **Which directory should Codex start in?** Use the **repo root** only for setup and global maintenance. For an actual research run, start Codex from the target **workspace root** (`workspaces/<project>/`), not from the repo root and not from `workspaces/<project>/current`. This makes Codex load the workspace-specific `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/loop-prompt.txt`, and project memory directly.

> **Parallel projects:** run **one Codex session/pane per workspace root**.

## Self-Evolution System

Sibyl doesn't just run research — it learns how to run research better. After every iteration, the system analyzes what worked, what failed, and what was inefficient, then automatically updates itself:

```

```

### Why Self-Evolution Actually Works

Most AI systems that claim to "learn" are stateful processes — they accumulate context within a single session, but lose everything when the process restarts. Sibyl takes a fundamentally different approach: **stateless architecture with persistent artifacts**.

- **Every prompt is loaded from disk at call time.** There is no in-memory cache, no long-running daemon. Each agent reads its prompt file (`sibyl/prompts/*.md`) fresh every time it is invoked. If the evolution engine rewrites a prompt, the very next agent call picks up the change — zero restart, zero redeployment.
- **Every agent runs as an independent subprocess.** Skills execute via `python3 -c "..."` in a fresh process, so Python modules are re-imported every time. Code changes in `sibyl/*.py` take effect immediately on the next stage.
- **Config is re-parsed per orchestrator call.** `cli_next()` instantiates a new `Orchestrator` each time, re-reading `config.yaml` from disk. Parameter tuning by the evolution engine is picked up on the next tick.
- **Lesson overlays are plain files.** Experience extracted from past projects is written to `.sibyl/evolution/lessons/{agent}.md` (or the runtime path overridden by `SIBYL_STATE_DIR` / `SIBYL_EVOLUTION_DIR`). The `load_prompt()` function appends the overlay content on every call — new lessons are injected into the next agent invocation automatically.

This means evolution is not a "batch update" that requires a maintenance window. It is a **continuous, incremental process**: the system that runs iteration N+1 is already different from the one that ran iteration N, because the reflection after iteration N has already modified prompts, overlays, and potentially code on disk. The entire system is designed so that **every file is the source of truth, and every file is read fresh** — making self-evolution a natural consequence of the architecture rather than a bolted-on feature.

**Safety**: All system file modifications are gated by mandatory tests (`.venv/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/`) and tracked via git commits, ensuring every evolution step is reversible and auditable.

**8 Issue Categories**: SYSTEM, EXPERIMENT, WRITING, ANALYSIS, PLANNING, PIPELINE, IDEATION, EFFICIENCY — each automatically routed to the relevant agents. The planner learns to design better experiments, the experimenter learns to use GPUs more efficiently, the writer learns to avoid recurring style issues — all without manual intervention.

## Self-Healing System

While the self-evolution system learns from *completed* iterations, the **self-healing system** operates in real time — continuously monitoring for runtime errors and fixing them autonomously as the research pipeline runs.

```

  Error Collector ──> Structured capture to logs/errors.jsonl
       |                    ├── Exception type, traceback, file, line

       |                    └── Automatic categorization (7 types)

       |                    ├── Priority sorting (import > build > type > test > ...)
       |                    ├── Skill routing (error type → repair skill pipeline)
       |                    └── Circuit breaker (3 failures → escalate to human)
       v
  Self-Healer Agent ──> Autonomous repair
       |                    ├── Invoke mapped skills (systematic-debugging, tdd-workflow, ...)
       |                    ├── Apply fix with scope limits (max 5 files, protected file rules)
       |                    ├── Generate regression test to prevent recurrence
       |                    └── Verify: full test suite must pass
       v
  Git Commit ──> fix(self-heal): <description> [auto]
                    └── All fixes tracked on dev branch, periodically synced to main
```

### How It Works

The self-healing system is a **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Error Collector** (`sibyl/error_collector.py`) — Captures runtime exceptions with full context (traceback, stage, project) into structured JSONL records. A `@wrap_cli` decorator automatically catches errors from all orchestrator CLI functions. Errors are categorized into 7 types: `import`, `test`, `type`, `state`, `config`, `build`, `prompt`.

2. **Error Router** (`sibyl/self_heal.py`) — Deduplicates errors by content hash, sorts by priority (import errors before config errors), and maps each error category to a repair skill pipeline via the **skill route table**. A circuit breaker prevents infinite fix loops: after 3 failed attempts on the same error, it is logged and skipped, then retried in the next iteration.

3. **Self-Healer Agent** (`sibyl-self-healer` skill) — A fork skill running on the standard tier (Opus) that receives repair tasks and autonomously:
   - Invokes the appropriate skills (e.g., `systematic-debugging` → `tdd-workflow`)
   - Applies the fix within scope limits (max 5 files per fix, surgical changes to protected files)
   - Writes a regression test covering the exact failure condition
   - Runs the full test suite to verify the fix
   - Commits with `fix(self-heal): ... [auto]` format for full traceability

### Safety Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Circuit breaker | Same error failing 3 times → stops and flags for human review |
| File scope limit | Max 5 files modified per fix — prevents over-reaching changes |
| Protected files | Core files like `orchestrate.py` only allow minimal, surgical edits |
| Test gate | Full test suite must pass before any fix is committed |
| Git tracking | Every fix is a separate commit on `dev` — fully reversible |

### Configuration

```yaml
self_heal_enabled: true        # Enable self-healing (default: true)
self_heal_interval_sec: 300    # Background scan interval (default: 5 min)
self_heal_max_attempts: 3      # Circuit breaker threshold (default: 3)
```

### Workspace Structure

Each research project has an independent filesystem under `workspaces/<project>/`:

```
workspaces/<project>/
├── CLAUDE.md                   # Effective runtime prompt (system + project memory)
├── status.json                 # Orchestrator state (stage/iteration/score)
├── config.yaml                 # Project-level config overrides
├── topic.txt / spec.md         # Research topic & requirements spec
├── .sibyl/project/             # Project memory and prompt overlays
├── context/literature.md       # Literature review
├── idea/                       # Proposals, alternatives, debate records
├── plan/                       # Experiment plan, task_plan.json
├── exp/                        # Code, results, logs, GPU progress
├── writing/                    # Outline, sections, reviews, full paper, LaTeX
├── logs/                       # Iteration archives, research diary
└── lark_sync/                  # Feishu/Lark sync registry
```

Repo-level helper utilities belong under `tools/`, not `workspaces/`. If a directory under `workspaces/` does not have Sibyl project state such as `status.json`, it should be moved out.

- **rich** >= 13.0 — Terminal formatted output

### Optional Tools

- [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) — Independent cross-review (opt in with `codex_enabled: true`)
- [Ralph Loop](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) — Autonomous iteration loop (Claude Code plugin)
- [AI Research Skills](https://github.com/orchestra-research/ai-research-skills) — 85 expert skills covering fine-tuning, inference, evaluation, paper writing, and more. When installed, Sibyl agents automatically discover relevant skills and invoke them on demand for best-practice guidance. See [setup guide](docs/setup-guide.md#step-10-ai-research-skills-optional) for installation.

## Key Mechanisms

### GPU Parallel Scheduling

The experiment stage reads `task_plan.json`, topologically sorts tasks by dependencies, then greedily assigns parallel execution based on available GPUs:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "train_baseline", "depends_on": [], "gpu_count": 2, "estimated_minutes": 60},
    {"id": "train_model_a", "depends_on": ["train_baseline"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 90},
    {"id": "train_model_b", "depends_on": ["train_baseline"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 90},
    {"id": "ablation", "depends_on": ["train_model_a", "train_model_b"], "gpu_count": 1, "estimated_minutes": 30}
  ]
}
```

### Cross-Project Self-Evolution

Lessons learned in one project automatically improve all future projects:

1. **Record**: Classify issues (8 categories) and success patterns after each iteration
2. **Analyze**: Aggregate with time-decay weighting (30-day half-life) — recent lessons matter more
3. **Normalize**: Canonicalize action plans (category/severity/status/trajectory) and assign stable `issue_key`s
4. **Apply**: Generate per-agent prompt overlays — each agent receives only the lessons relevant to its role and current context
5. **Prune**: Remove stale overlays automatically when no longer supported by current insights
6. **Self-Check**: Detect quality decline and recurring unresolved errors

### PIVOT Mechanism

When experiment results are unsatisfactory, the supervisor decision agent can trigger PIVOT:

- Analyze whether results support the original hypothesis
- Evaluate whether continued investment is worthwhile
- If PIVOT: roll back to idea debate stage with alternative proposals
- Maximum 6 PIVOT cycles (configurable)
